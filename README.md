# invariance_without_adversaries
This is demonstration code for [Invariant Representations Without Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09458), a paper in NIPS 2018.

More content will be added to this repo after the first author finishes his candidacy documents(!),
but the basic experiment for Fair Representation (using the "Adult" dataset from the UCI ML repo) is ```./experimental_script.sh```
run from the base directory.

Please excuse the structure and composition of this code; it's just a demo.
