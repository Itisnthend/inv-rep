# Invariant Representations without Adversaries
This was a repo of demonstration code for
[Invariant Representations Without Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09458),
a paper in NIPS 2018.

Please excuse the structure and composition of this code; it's just a demo.

I have since written a tutorial in Keras, held [in this other repo](https://github.com/dcmoyer/invariance-tutorial),
and a corresponding blog post held [here](https://dcmoyer.github.io/selfhosted/blag.html).
In my opinion, this other repository is much cleaner.
